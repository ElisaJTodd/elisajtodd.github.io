My last semester, our class learned to program on LOGO and Visual Basic. I fell in love with what computers could do then, or more accurately what I could make a computer do. For my first semester of College, learning the basics of coding and problem solving in Introduction to Computer Science was amazing. I felt that with only if statements, loops, and arrays I could do just about anything. Each day, I am learning more things about CS that widen my view of the possibilities and I keep finding each new topic very exciting. I find myself looking for any opportunity to develop my skills and learn from the outside. I am very happy to say that I am now working as an Instructional Assistant for the class of Elementary Data Structures, also known as CS2, and have begun working with Google in a Research Mentorship Program. I hope that I can obtain internships such as Google\u2019s STEP soon so that I start developing my skills on another environment and learn more about CS."),o.a.createElement("p",null,"My strongest programming language is Java. This is the language that I first learned to code on and have been coding in it for almost a year and a half. Plus, as an Instructional Assistant, understanding and debugging Java is part of my everyday work. I am now using Python for my classes and found it easy to transfer to it given that I already had skills like indentation developed, and Python is very forgiving with variable declarations, semicolons, and printing among other things. I made many school projects with Java, some more challenging than others. I have made programs to calculate a student\u2019s grade, check the validity of a credit card using the Luhn method, creating a valid credit card number, checking if the solution to a sudoku puzzle is right, using Quicksort, Making a Family Tree with a Binary Tree, and more.

Transitioning to an American college has been easy, as the culture here in El Paso is a friendly mix of Mexico and the US. This has made me able to take the best of both worlds. My family is made up of computer scientists as well. My two older brothers are graduating this next December and May. I was aware that there was a big gap on the number of women and men majoring in computer science, and it has been very noticeable from the beginning. Yet, I don\u2019t feel like being a woman has made my path any more difficult, on the contrary, I feel encouraged to show women that we can do it.
